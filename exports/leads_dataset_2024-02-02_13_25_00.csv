We found this restaurant on Google while looking for something that offered traditional Swedish food. The food, service, and experience did not disappoint. Our server explained this was the oldest restaurant in the world and opened in 1722. We enjoyed the shrimp and herring starters with classical schnapps, the Swedish meatballs and venison for mains, followed by the raspberry parfait. I'd highly recommend making a reservation as they are quite busy.","Review by Amy Shin

I had a great smorgasbord dinner at the Verandan. The food was delicious and bountiful, and gave me a great perspective on Swedish cuisine. The friendly waiter guided me through the eating experience, making sure that I added for right sauces to the dishes. Sadly, the smorgasbord at the Grand Hotel is only one of two left in Stockholm.","Review by James Eisnor 
So the buffet is only available on weekends but I decided to come in anyway and do the three course meal for lunch. The staff was so kind and answered all questions I had about the food and the area.

Shout out to Roland who was my server. Such a kind man and gave me his personal recommendations for drinks and a brief history on red tea which I found very interesting. If I'm ever in Stockholm again I will definitely be returning","Review by Val Bpsoma

The place is a small shop with abt 4 tables. Food is more takeaway style but heated in a microwave, if dine in. Service is great. The staff explained to us what selections are available and was patient with us tourist. Selection is local food. Good for office lunch. But not great if expecting more. The meat and pancake lunch boxes, when heated, is quite rubbery. The surprise is the self-service salad. Fresh. Crunchy. Delicious.","Review by ÂºµÂ∫≠ÊØì 
The restaurant is soooo nice. 5 huge meet balls with potatoes is 160 SEK. The taste and the texture of the meatballs are perfect! Also there are salad, bread, water and coffee for free, which you can eat so full.  The best part of the cute small restaurant I would say is the shopkeeper. He‚Äôs so nice and enthusiastic, pretty friendly with all the customers ‚ò∫Ô∏è  highly recommended!","Review by X T (George) 
Staff was hospitable enough to explain what each dish was and the allergens. Takeaway style food that was equally amazing as it was microwaved when dining it. I highly recommend the bacon and pancakes.",https://www.google.com/maps/place/Mom%27s+Kitchen+Nybrogatan/data=!4m7!3m6!1s0x465f9d44de4750c3:0x6b38967126e20a16!8m2!3d59.3379997!4d18.0805937!16s%2Fg%2F11cm0kpzmd!19sChIJw1BH3kSdX0YRFgriJnGWOGs?authuser=0&hl=en&rclk=1,null,null,PENDING,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If you don't have enough time, it's good option to eat fish in Stockholm. We went there at dinner around 18:30 on Moday in August, 2023. They served foods fast. The tasting was good. The price was also good.","Review by Luciano Zaami 
Nice food. I had a great fish burger. Quantity was perfect, I got full. I've been there during lunch, the place was quite full but if you avoid to go between 12 and 1pm, you can find a more calmer place. Price are good, not expensive.","Review by Victoire Provost 
Very good! I took the fish burger and the fish was perfectly cooked but the potatoes and the salsa were too salty. The whole was also a bit expensive. Careful: it closes super early (8pm)",https://www.google.com/maps/place/Restaurant+The+Fishery/data=!4m7!3m6!1s0x465f9d5e91eca39b:0x4b7d4a67be08a4bc!8m2!3d59.3316642!4d18.0666728!16s%2Fg%2F11hzsw0qwb!19sChIJm6PskV6dX0YRvKQIvmdKfUs?authuser=0&hl=en&rclk=1,null,null,PENDING,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
