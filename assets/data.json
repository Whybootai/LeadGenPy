I got the traditional meatball dish and it was great. Each meal comes with a salad and bread plate, already on the table when you arrive. Service was good, though I wish they checked on me more often.",
    "top_review_2": "Review by Jessica Rodrigues \nWe were in Stockholm for a few days but this restaurant served us incredibly good meatballs. The service was impeccable and attentive. The food was truly delicious, from appetizer to dessert everything astounded us and exceeded all our expectations. One thing is for sure, if I return to Stockholm I will come back here as well! highly recommended.",
    "top_review_3": "Review by Stefan Hendrickx \nWould highly recommend for visitors interested in getting a selection of Swedish classics like the herring (SOS), meatballs, or Kroppkaka (my favourite). After sampling at different restaurants this remains our favourite.\nStaff is very friendly and welcoming and though it's not the most local experience (it's in the old town after all) it is a great experience and atmosphere.",

Everything was delicious.\n\n*We ordered on a Friday from the lunch menu and revealed complimentary coffee and cookies afterwards.\n\nService was great - attentive and friendly staff who brought the orders quickly and checked up on us  without being pushy.\n\nOverall cost about 70\u20ac, but was well worth it!",

The food was really nice, I had the shrimp for the starter and reindeer medallions for meat. Both are savory and well-done. I also got the mousse for a dessert. Although tasty, it was too small for me. The waiter and waitress were super friendly and nice, and I enjoyed the whole experience. In the summer time, the outdoor area should be wonderful and the indoor should be cozy any time. Be mindful that they may ask you for additional tip which is not common in Sweden?

I'd highly recommend making a reservation as they are quite busy.",

    "top_review_2": "Review by Mike L. \nOk so I am breaking down my review into two parts. One for the overall normal experience and the other for the special occasion.\n\n1) Food: All the appetizers and main courses were tasty. The combo of flavors is definitely on point. Though for the lobster bisque I would personally prefer some lobster bits in it and the entrec\u00f4te ribeye itself can be a bit higher quality (nitpicking) but the seasoning and taste is good. The portions were just right so we weren\u2019t too full or starving.\n\n2) The service was great. Our waitress was super friendly and knew how to work the table! Honestly I don\u2019t have too much to say because the service was that good.\n\n3) Atmosphere was ok. Nothing stands out too much, it was fine. It could be a bit more spacious, since we bumped into the table behind us sometimes when we got up, but it was not like we couldn\u2019t get out at all. Also parking might be a problem unless you go to the narrow parking garage nearby.\n\n4) Price is high. It is an expensive restaurant but you get what you paid for\u2026sort of. I think some dishes are definitely overpriced like the entrec\u00f4te which cost 450kr! Again the restaurant is located in \u00d6stermalm, an upscaled area, so what did I expect. Nevertheless, it is pricey but at least you will get good food.\n\nSo the special occasion is the reason why I am not giving a five star. It is unfortunate but I can\u2019t ignore it.\n\nWe were there because we were celebrating a birthday. We brought a cake and asked if they could refrigerate it and serve it afterwards. Some places would do it for free, some would charge a small service charge. Both options are fine. But for  how much we were spending there, I thought they would do it for free. Other restaurants might decline but that\u2019s rare. Instead came the absolute shock of my life.\n\nThe waitress told us they could do it for a service fee, which is fine but it was for per person! I repeat, the service fee was for per person! I am not joking. The service fee ended up costing more than the cake. In fact, you could have gotten an appetizer and a main. It was ridiculously expensive. Even the waitress thought it was extremely unfair. But since it was new years soon and we weren\u2019t gonna see each other for a while, and not to ruin the mood, we paid for the service fee.\n\nThat why I can\u2019t give a full five star, I mean you are only giving us some plates and cutleries, why are you charging so much?? For per person??? Even though not all of us had the cake\u2026..",

    "top_review_2": "Review by Alexandros Giatzoglou \nReally nice experience. The level of food and service is very high. I totally recommend langoustine (Nordic lobster) starter and duck as a main.\n\nWhat I would not recommend is booking table after 8.30 pm because at 11 pm sharp you need to leave and there may not be enough time to enjoy your dinner.",
    "top_review_3": "Review by Amanda W \nOne of hardest restaurants in town to get a table.  And it was definitely worth the visit.  Well prepared food with interesting blend of tastes at a reasonable price in a casual laidback setting. Excellent service and recommendation of wine to the dishes.\n\nMy favorites were the starter Kantareller med morot och lavendel and dessert - bakad vaniljkr\u00e4m med salsa macadamian\u00f6tter  och getostskum.  Yummy!",

I set back the hip quotient exponentially.  Food was consistent and good.  Cocktails were made well, and throughout the restaurant liquor flowed.  You will have a good time at Portal.  Service was nice, but quite taken with itself.  Their flippant attitude was the one negative.",
    "top_review_3": "Review by Collin Donoho \nFound this place on the Eaters guide and sure did not disappoint. They do have a sister bar next door as well. We walked into what seemed a very lowkey restaurant serving traditional Swedish fare with a twist. For our reservation, we sat at the bar, and it was lovely. The menu has many options, and the wine list is expansive. Service was fantastic by everyone, and super friendly. Everything we had was very tasty as well -",

Such a kind man and gave me his personal recommendations for drinks and a brief history on red tea which I found very interesting. If I'm ever in Stockholm again I will definitely be returning",

The staff explained to us what selections are available and was patient with us tourist. Selection is local food. Good for office lunch. But not great if expecting more. The meat and pancake lunch boxes, when heated, is quite rubbery. The surprise is the self-service salad. Fresh. Crunchy. Delicious.",

Also there are salad, bread, water and coffee for free, which you can eat so full.  The best part of the cute small restaurant I would say is the shopkeeper.

I can highly recommend the pork bao. It was melt in your mouth with a large portion to share with the table. They also had a fun take on oysters if your looking for some aphrodisiacs or just a good taste.",
