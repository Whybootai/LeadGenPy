I got the traditional meatball dish and it was great. Each meal comes with a salad and bread plate, already on the table when you arrive. Service was good, though I wish they checked on me more often.",

The food was truly delicious, from appetizer to dessert everything astounded us and exceeded all our expectations. One thing is for sure, if I return to Stockholm I will come back here as well! highly recommended.",
    "top_review_3": "Review by Stefan Hendrickx \nWould highly recommend for visitors interested in getting a selection of Swedish classics like the herring (SOS), meatballs, or Kroppkaka (my favourite). After sampling at different restaurants this remains our favourite.\nStaff is very friendly and welcoming and though it's not the most local experience (it's in the old town after all) it is a great experience and atmosphere.",

    "top_review_2": "Review by Mike L. \nOk so I am breaking down my review into two parts. One for the overall normal experience and the other for the special occasion.\n\n1) Food: All the appetizers and main courses were tasty. The combo of flavors is definitely on point. Though for the lobster bisque I would personally prefer some lobster bits in it and the entrec\u00f4te ribeye itself can be a bit higher quality (nitpicking) but the seasoning and taste is good. The portions were just right so we weren\u2019t too full or starving.\n\n2) The service was great. Our waitress was super friendly and knew how to work the table! Honestly I don\u2019t have too much to say because the service was that good.\n\n3) Atmosphere was ok. Nothing stands out too much, it was fine. It could be a bit more spacious, since we bumped into the table behind us sometimes when we got up, but it was not like we couldn\u2019t get out at all. Also parking might be a problem unless you go to the narrow parking garage nearby.\n\n4) Price is high. It is an expensive restaurant but you get what you paid for\u2026sort of. I think some dishes are definitely overpriced like the entrec\u00f4te which cost 450kr! Again the restaurant is located in \u00d6stermalm, an upscaled area, so what did I expect. Nevertheless, it is pricey but at least you will get good food.\n\nSo the special occasion is the reason why I am not giving a five star. It is unfortunate but I can\u2019t ignore it.\n\nWe were there because we were celebrating a birthday. We brought a cake and asked if they could refrigerate it and serve it afterwards. Some places would do it for free, some would charge a small service charge. Both options are fine. But for  how much we were spending there, I thought they would do it for free. Other restaurants might decline but that\u2019s rare. Instead came the absolute shock of my life.\n\nThe waitress told us they could do it for a service fee, which is fine but it was for per person! I repeat, the service fee was for per person! I am not joking. The service fee ended up costing more than the cake. In fact, you could have gotten an appetizer and a main. It was ridiculously expensive. Even the waitress thought it was extremely unfair. But since it was new years soon and we weren\u2019t gonna see each other for a while, and not to ruin the mood, we paid for the service fee.\n\nThat why I can\u2019t give a full five star, I mean you are only giving us some plates and cutleries, why are you charging so much?? For per person??? Even though not all of us had the cake\u2026..",

The ambiance is warm and welcoming, making it the perfect place for a memorable meal. I was recommended this place by a lot of locals and guides. Fortunately for me, there was a single-person table in one of the corners. They take no reservation so it's luck in peak hours and you have to wait outside.\n\nI was welcomed by two lovely ladies who operated the entire front. Now, onto the star of the show: the food. The meatballs at this restaurant are nothing short of legendary. They are the epitome of Swedish comfort food, tender, flavorful, and served with a heavenly cream sauce that's simply to die for. Each bite was a taste of culinary perfection, and it's easy to see why they're renowned. The shrimp toast here is equally exceptional. It's crispy on the outside and bursting with flavor. The combination of succulent shrimp and a delectable sauce is great. It's an absolute must-try for seafood enthusiasts just like everything else here.",

My favourite is the esparagus variation followed by the fish in kimchi butter and ponzy with grapes from the farm. The new restaurant that opens in 2022 will be bigger and more expensive but probably also will worth it!\nThe most easy 5 stars a place can get!

    "top_review_2": "Review by Anna Chilton \nWhat an experience! The host, Ian, welcomed me even though I didn\u2019t have a reservation. I was given a spot at the bar and tasted the smoky twist on an Old Fashioned, which was delectable. There is a handful of cocktails and each is a take on a classic. The wine menu is a thing of beauty, even by the glass. Swedish wine, both sparking (an affable variety, Solaris) and still, feature by glass and bottle menus. There are classic options and iconic wines, classy new world options (like Hamilton Russel) and an orange wine.\nI was lucky to receive a tour of the kitchen where the chef kindly showed us how the wood fired Swedish ovens work. All the food is sourced as locally as possible, with many ingredients conserved from the summer months.\nThe menu is 16 courses. I only tried 4 and each morsel left a memory of layered, unfolding flavours and textures, crafted and sat on beautiful ceramics.\nIt\u2019s worth noting the diversity of the youthful team, adding nuances to the dishes with inspiration from various regions in Sweden and further afield.\nThe atmosphere is relaxed enough to attract a diverse crowd of food lovers, there was a young couple, an older group of friends, a couple of lone travellers (me and an American lady). That said, you do know, as soon as you walk in, that you\u2019ve entered into a place for serious food lovers. There\u2019s a focus about the place, with each member of staff deeply attentive to the main event - serving you.\nPrepare to be pampered into an olfactory journey by these masters of food and drink.\nWorth a journey to Stockholm. Enjoy!",

However, I noticed some glass near the entrance inside was broken (no shards of glass had been left unswept to be clear), but this was my only concern. Tables are a little close together in spots, so they may be inaccessible to larger people or disabled people. Staff were not impolite and were quite friendly, yet after a while, they seemed to want us to leave as we had not ordered more food, which I suppose is quite fair. That being said, I do think Nomad is worth a visit for what I believe to be authentic Swedish meatballs at a decent price, and the atmosphere in the restaurant is quite pleasant, but I would advise that once you're finished your meal, either order dessert or don't overstay your welcome.",

Definitely quite a pricy meal (but we'd had some much cheaper meals earlier in the week so could justify this as an end-of-the-holiday treat).\n\nI love the fact that their menu changes seasonally, and if I'm in Stockholm again any time soon, I will definitely be making another visit to Smak.",

The set meal featured traditional Swedish Christmas starters like cold prawn hors d'oeuvre, lox, marinated herring with Kalix L\u00f6jrom, duck liver p\u00e2te, ham, V\u00e4sterbotten cheese, crispbread and spice bread. This was followed by a warm main of duck breast with root fruits accompanied by fried kale. Dessert was a dark chocolate mousse topped with soft maraschino cherries and a fruit sobert. Drinks cost extra. Overall fantastic, professional staff, classic setting.\n\nWe were seated with a lovely view of a wintry Kungstr\u00e4dg\u00e5rden. Food wise, the crisp bread and cheese were amazing and marinated herring was fresh. The duck breast was a letdown, overcooked and hard. The dessert is a chocolate and cherry lovers' delight but didn't appeal to me. My order of Chardonnay was a pleasant drink that was full of flavourful notes. The Swedish brewed coffee was a smooth medium roast that provided a good wrap up to our visit.\n\nIt is not mandatory to have the Christmas set as you can also order \u00e1 la carte. Reservations recommended as this restaurant is very popular.",

Also the service had problems helping us with our drink selection and didn't/couldn't present the dishes. The vanilla bavaroise and the entre toast were the best dishes!",

The attention to detail and the service was top notch.  They noted my dislike of apples with the welcome drink and asked if I would like a substitution for an apple forward dessert.  The food was scrumptious and the kitchen operated seamlessly like a well oiled machine.  We had the best seats in the house allowing us to view the kitchen.  The meal at this restaurant is lingering in my memory as a favorite experience.   I look forward to our next visit.",

The non-alcoholic beverage pairing was great, each drink paired well with the food and had complex flavors with interesting ingredients and techniques used to make them. My pescetarian dinner was perfect, the celeriac root was the best vegetable I\u2019ve ever eaten with such a tender texture and smoky, deep flavor. The food is all salty but food in Sweden is salty, it\u2019s just a different flavor profile than places like England. Small portions but a lot of food, you will leave very full.",

I've been to most places around town and this really blew my mind. We ate for two people and shared the dishes as this was our most preferred way of dining. Very fun and creative dishes. The complexity of the dishes were high and every herb was used in a very profound way - which matched the proposed wine in a very refined way.\n\nWhat ever you decided to choose, please feel comfortable asking the staff as they are very knowledgable. We had some amazing food with a good tempo between meals to enjoy conversation and sip the excellent wine. I wish we had more time for drinks and if I would have re-made this evening I would most definitely plan for pre-drink or after drinks in the bar. Extra shout out to the staff that took care of us super well.\n\nI really enjoyed walking into a strange entrance and revel in a new world.

    "top_review_1": "Review by Emmm M \nWe\u2019ve been here for dinner a couple of years ago and the atmosphere and view is still the most romantic in Gothenburg. The food is good, my fish was amazing and my boyfriend\u2019s veal was ok, but needed a proper meat knife. We actually asked for another knife but the second one was just as blunt as the first one... Still, it\u2019s not \u201cthe best\u201d food experience according to my very particular taste, but well worth the time and money. I\u2019d come again, for the overall experience no doubt! We had the tartar starter that was good but over ambitious so some of the flavors are lost, to much going on, and the soup which was nice. Enjoyed everything. I have to give a comment about the service, best waitress in forever! Corona has certainly had an impact on what you expect but the service at View from the waitress was better than most places. 10 out of five stars for service without a doubt! Attentive, fast and friendly. Feels as friendly as your local pub but service at Michelin level. Amazing and I don\u2019t know how you do it!",

We were both vegetarian and non-veg and it was impossible to just order two separate selections of tapas from the menu, the server wanted us all to order together which made the whole experience confusing and not so fun.\n\nThe servers also kept squeezing in between me and the table to get to the dishes or to serve food instead of politely announcing their presence and smoothly making their way, which annoyed me. They made me feel like I was in their way.\n\nThe food was good (above average I would say for the price point) but alot of what arrived at the table were not warm. Almost cold.\n\nThe atmosphere were that of a hotel restaurant I think, not very cosy, but it was located in connection to a mall so maybe that added to the not so cosy feeling.",

Three of us had the beef as main which was a bit too tough for the price.

When I asked questions about the menu, their responses were condescending and unhelpful. It's disappointing to have your dining experience soured by staff attitudes. The food may have been decent, but the lack of courtesy and respect from the staff left a lasting negative impression.

For starter we took deer tartar and roe. The roe was simple but of good quality; deer tartar had crispy root vegetable on the top, which made the dish balanced and interesting. For desert we took wheat ice cream and puff pastry with yoghurt ice cream. Can very much recommend the wheat ice cream - such an unique taste! Usually we find restaurant desert very heavy and it would become almost a pain to eat with a full stomach, but their deserts were light and not that sweet, giving the whole meal a very nice end.",
    "top_review_2": "Review by Liu Malory \nSwedish cuisine with a modern twist, I would give 4.5 stars coz there is an improvement that can be done.\nThe food materials of this place were selected from local providers, that is good not only because we could know the source of the food but also supporting local businesses.\nThe cured char fish had totally removed the fishy odor and the green tomatoes had neutralized the heaviness of the fish. It was very appetizing. The coriander cream with lamb was a genius combo, together with the multi types of veggies served, it was a dish that made you focus more on veggies than the meat. The flavors of veggies were brought up and enhanced by the flavors of lamb grease. The cloudberry pancake was served with melted brown butter, sounds greasy but in fact it was tasty, a perfect balance of milky and fruity flavors. It was a pity that I\u2019m allergic to nuts and could not enjoy the almond ice cream, which I believe was better than the vanilla one.\nThe improvement can be done is the selection of the cut of the lamb. Mine piece of lamb had a lot of tendons inside, which was hard to chew on.",

I like seasonality of their cuisine - all the time there is a fresh fish in the menu, great quality lamb and wild meat during autumn season. Also, vegetarian options are so good that I started to eat more vegetarian foods",

Chicken curry might taste good for people who love sweet curries.",

The Naan was so amazing and they did not over work the dough and it was cooked perfectly. It was soft and delicious. The Lamb Korma was delightful and the Chicken Tika Masala was tender and just the right amount of heat. We loved the vegetarian Samosa is a real treat. Shamon was our waiter is very personable.\nAt lunch they serve 200 for lunch and dinner is very quite. This place is a MUST EAT!",
    "top_review_3": "Review by Peter Forsberg \nA small little Indian restaurant with a great atmosphere and friendly staff who meets you at the door. Lamb Madras was excellent and so even the naan bread. Rice was plated which gave the impression of a very small portion of rice. I would rather have received it in a bowl. Most restaurants in Sweden do not offer doggy bag for leftovers, however to my surprise this restaurant actually did which results in food not being thrown away.",

As a guest you are taking through a nice set menu with innovative and interesting dishes.\n\nThe location in Kristineberg right beside the Kristineberg castle on Kungsholmen is a little bit off the \"usual\" Stockholm restaurant location, but I think that only adds to the atmosphere.",

Actually before going I was hesitating because it snowed outside, but I\u2019m grateful that I choose to go finally. Totally worth it even in snow days.\n\nIt\u2019s a pity that I will leave Sweden in September and might not have a chance to visit again before they having the summer break, but I will make sure to come back again in the future.

They mix the rice with a readymade curry when we ask for Biryani instead of cooking meat along with the rice . The lamb sukka rice had awful gamey smell of lamb instead of chetinadu masala\u2019s smell. We couldn\u2019t eat it past a couple of spoons and  left it on the table. Fish 65 was made out of salmon and I had no idea that we use Salmon in South Indian cooking . At least the waitress should have notified us. The chicken 65 was overcooked and rubbery. Speaking of the sides, we were served a day old or 2 days old lettuce which were so wilted.\nThey open the restaurant at 12 and we booked our table at 1.30.But by the time we reached there, they ran of parottas already. \ud83d\ude14\ud83d\ude14\ud83d\ude14\ud83d\ude14",

The desert though is not good at all, absolutely too large first of all, I got full just by looking at it. Too sweet. The wines though are really not in my taste, I don't like French wines, I prefer Italian or Spanish wines. Service good but the atmosphere is very much \"Stureplan\" and a lot of rich youngsters there. Not really my type of place.",

Yet the starter dish of the squid was the rotten apple in the bucket.\nThe beef tartar was very simple in the ingredients, unlike a lot of other places serving beef tartar with a lot of creamy sauce. Thus the original flavors of the meat was brought out properly. The mille-feuille was very crispy, and not overwhelmingly sweet, which was exactly to my liking. The pizza was the best I had in Stockholm, the pumpkin matched so well with the red pepper, spring onions and cheese. The bottom was super thin and crispy as well. However the squid with beans was not as pleasant as the other dishes, the flavors didn\u2019t match with each other, and the odor of seafood was not removed.\nThe environment was a bit too dim and too crowded, that our neighbor\u2019s butt almost ran into our plate when he tried to get into the seat.",

Very high quality ingredients carefully had picked and many of the ingredients were home made as well such as soya sauce and ginger pickles. The omakase starts with miso soup which already showed that it is not just any other Japanese place. Then we had several sashimis where all of them were really good but what striked me most was the scallops with foie gras, fresh truffle and caviar. It was explosion of flavours. Then we had several sushi pieces including three type of tuna, which of course fatty tuna was the highlight. Another sushi pieces to remember was the sea bream with lime and salt. The sushi courses ended with wagyu bite which was lightly torched in front of us. And the closure with a roasted sesame ice cream. The non alcoholic drink options were rich and suitable to pair with dishes. I can\u2019t recommend enough if you would like to have an experience for a special day.",

The pork and thousand-year egg porridge was very creamy yet still preserved the texture of lean pork and egg. The deep fried bread was super crispy and fluffy. The Chung Fun (steamed rice paper wraps) was silky smooth and perfectly seasoned. If you want to try authentic Cantonese Dim Sum (Cantonese Chinese tapas) in Stockholm, this is the place.\nFirst visit June 2022: This might look like just another place serves terrible Chinese fusion, but actually it serves really authentic Cantonese cuisine during the weekends! The sweet pork buns are juicy and soft. The other Dim Sum are just like what I had in HK back in the days. Each piece of the fried rice is totally separated and that\u2019s an important indicator for a decent fried rice. Make sure to request for the dim sum menu during weekend afternoons!",

They were very happy with the food served.  The food was very tasty from my perspective.. I had ordered  the vegetarian options from there ... It almost felt like home for me ( was very similar to Indian food to be honest ) .\nI was surprised at how accurately the person brought the food after the order as they didn't make  any notes  when 8 of us ordered ... \ud83e\udd23\n\nThe place offered great food, service was nice and the decorations gave an amazing vibe.\nNote : The reservation you make may not matter as the place doesn't look at it at all... You have the old fashioned way of arriving early and awaiting your turn..",

The food was incredibly delicious, made with high-quality ingredients. I opted for the vegan main course with various small dishes. I've had Ethiopian cuisine before, but this experience was exceptional. The injera was exceptionally well-made and very fresh. I highly recommend this restaurant.",

I\u2019ve been for both dine-in and take-away (to-go).\n\nIf you\u2019re not sure what to order, I recommend getting one of the Beyeayenetu plates (meat or veggie) under Huvudr\u00e4tter, so you can try a sampling of various things. Definitely enough to feed 2 people in my opinion. Be prepared to eat with your hands (saw a lady using a rubber glove last time, so brilliant).\n\nRestaurant is fairly large with lots of tables. Great decor and lively atmosphere. Service is friendly, though maybe a little slow at first. But it was quite busy.",

This small gem is worth a full detour!",
    "top_review_2": "Review by Tina Liu \nJapanese fusion, tapas (small plates) styled restaurant. Food we ordered was all quite good. Fish tasted fresh. My favorite was probably the fried beef dumplings. Least favorite was the fried chicken, as it was mainly batter and sauce, and the chicken itself was a little dry.\n\nAmbience and decor is fun and trendy. Service and staff were all friendly and helpful.\n\nOnly downside I would say is the price. At ~100-150kr ($10-15) a plate and 2-3 plates per person, the bill stacks up fast. If you come hungry and want a drink, be prepared to pay 500kr+ ($50) per person.\n\nThat being said I\u2019d still come back and recommend this place for a special night out.

I have never had such eloquently placed creaminess along with spices that tantalized my palette. Ordered as a group and we got all of the naan flavors which were amazing (magical butter?); the butter masala chicken was sweetened beyond what I\u2019m used to but it worked marvelously; the fire chicken pakora was insanely HOT and spicy but each bite left me wanting more; the tandoori chicken was amazingly juicy and came with a side of tandoori sauce to dip which was excellent; the lettuce wrapped paneer was mild, spiced well, and a perfect wrap up for the table; and the fresh made coconut ice cream (kokosglass) and kulfi were the best deserts to cool down the stomach and cleanse the palette at the end.

The setup felt like a Swedish Chipotle In a way.\n\nThe service was fine and the food came out rather quick.\n\nThe burritos could have had a bit better distribution of the meat as we got a big lump of meat in the bottom of the burrito. Another slight downside was that the meat was slightly too salty\n\nOverall I would totally recommend this spot for lunch as you get a good amount of food for a very reasonable price",

    "top_review_3": "Review by Charlotte Alvord \nAte the carnitas in naked burrito form, so everything without the tortilla. I added guacamole and substituted black beans for pinto beans. I love Mexican food and was really hoping that this would be a good experience, but I couldn't enjoy my meal. The carnitas meat and guacamole were so salty that after taking a few bites and I decided that it was way too salty, and I like salt, but this was just way too much. The pinto beans were undercooked so they were still hard, I had to spit them out. I couldn't enjoy the meal at all and decided that I could not eat it and had to send it back. So spoke to the girl behind the counter and she was really upset that it was inedible. She said that she would contact the kitchen and let them know. There is apparently one central kitchen in town and they then send out their already made dishes to the restaurants. So the food is not cooked at the restaurant's location, there is no chef/cook there.\n\nI would give this place 0 stars, but am giving them 1 because they were nice and gave me my money back. The girl behind the counter contacted her boss and they decided to swish me the amount that I paid for; as they were having problems with their cashier system, which is totally cool and really appreciated that they found a solution even though the technology had crashed.\n\nMy suggestion is save your money, hop on the tram and go to Tom Toms in Linn\u00e9staden. Much better food, there they cook their food at the location and I have eaten there several times, with always a good experience each time.\n\nSorry Wrapped Burrito Bar, you won't be having me as a customer again.",

The view was great, fancy furnishings and friendly service. The drink, especially the mocktails, can be improved, they taste a bit boring and similar to each other, the decoration and choice of glass weren't very impressive. The food were fine, recommend steak sandwich. Fair price. Very curious to come back to see the difference in Ama restaurant in 1st floor and try the classic cocktails there.",

Desserts were great, but the main was another story.\n\nDon't order the steak tartar if you expect a classic dish, because here it's buried under a load of other things. If you don't know what it is: order it because it still tastes good, but not as a steak tartar. The wonton dish was excellent.\n\nWe had some simple starters  (chips and padron), they were overpriced.
