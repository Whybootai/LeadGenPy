The ambiance is warm and welcoming, making it the perfect place for a memorable meal. I was recommended this place by a lot of locals and guides. Fortunately for me, there was a single-person table in one of the corners. They take no reservation so it's luck in peak hours and you have to wait outside.\n\nI was welcomed by two lovely ladies who operated the entire front. Now, onto the star of the show: the food. The meatballs at this restaurant are nothing short of legendary. They are the epitome of Swedish comfort food, tender, flavorful, and served with a heavenly cream sauce that's simply to die for. Each bite was a taste of culinary perfection, and it's easy to see why they're renowned. The shrimp toast here is equally exceptional. It's crispy on the outside and bursting with flavor. The combination of succulent shrimp and a delectable sauce is great. It's an absolute must-try for seafood enthusiasts just like everything else here.", "top_review_2": "Review by Tanvir Hasan Sadi \nIt\u2019s worth the wait in the queue. Lovely old town atmosphere.
